        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            From 2011 to 2021 I lived in the Middle East.  While there I was able
            to enjoy some of the most incredible food.  Spicy mandis, cheesy manakesh, 
            simple shawarmas, and, best of all, bright and lemony lentil soup.
        </p>
        <p>
            This soup reminds me so much of my time in the Middle East.  It has the deep warming
            flavor of the lentil soups I enjoyed there, with a fresh pop of lemony flavor to 
            brighten it up.  It is a light soup that won't leave you with a heavy
            feeling stomach, which makes it a good soup to enjoy all year round.  It pairs well
            with yummy garlic bread, or with some cheesy manakesh.
        </p>
        <p>
            This soup is quick and easy, with few ingredients.  This makes it a snap to throw
            together on those busy days, and makes it very wallet friendly.
            A serving of this is enough for lunch or light dinner, but you can also pair it with 
            a salad and bread for a more well rounded meal.
